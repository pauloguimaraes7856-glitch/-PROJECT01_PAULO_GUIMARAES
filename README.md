# StudyTrack Landing Page

A simple landing page project created for my web development class.  
It demonstrates the following concepts:

- Semantic HTML (Header, Main, Footer, Section, Article)
- CSS Flexbox
- CSS classes and specificity
- CSS import and variables
- Navigation between multiple pages
- Responsive design (mobile-first with media queries)
- Meta data (description, keywords, favicon, language tag)
- CSS transitions and hover animations
